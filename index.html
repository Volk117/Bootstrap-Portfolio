		<p>My name is Armando Amor and i was born in Mexico in 1989, as kid growing in the 90's i got really interested in computers and ince early age i started to play around with them, now as an adult im hoping to make a career out of my passion for it, i got some experience in coding and web design from back in my days of highschool, we didnt need it for school but me and my friends would play around with it and actually make a profit out of it on school events because other students would "hire us" to make stuff for them, its amazing when you can earn a living doing what you love.</p>
